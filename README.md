Hackathon entry for Developer Week Hackathon!

Please install docker and put in this command.

docker run -p 8080:8080 ravendb/ravendb:ubuntu-latest

Please Install Java Library into your IDE.

I recommend an IDE from JetBrains or Visual Studio Code where you may use extensions.

I used Retools a platform that reads and translate data into UI quickly. Would recommend if you are new to RavenDB to get a feel for how everything works with the API and RavenCloud.
